# Matter Certis v2 - Implementation Status Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Priority (Updated Jan 2025)

**DECISION: Crawling Engine Core Implementation First**

After analyzing the CSA-IoT website structure and configuration management requirements, **crawling engine core** has been prioritized.

### Rationale
1. **Clear Technical Requirements**: Concrete implementation targets from CSA-IoT page analysis
2. **Immediate Value**: Real Matter product data collection provides tangible value
3. **Configuration Foundation**: Understanding actual crawling workload informs better configuration design
4. **Reduced Dependencies**: Can start with basic configuration, advanced config management requires complex UI/UX

## ðŸ“Š CSA-IoT Analysis Results

- **Pagination**: 476+ pages (thousands of Matter products)
- **Product Cards**: Company, product name, certificate ID, description, detail URL
- **Detail Pages**: Technical specs, firmware/hardware versions, certification dates, compliance docs
- **Filter Parameters**: Product type, device type, program type, company filters

## ðŸš§ Phase 4: Crawling Engine Core (1-2 weeks)

### 4.1 Basic Infrastructure (Days 1-2)
- [ ] `MatterProductsCrawler` struct and HTTP client
- [ ] Rate limiting, retry logic, error handling framework  
- [ ] Matter products database schema and repository

### 4.2 Listing Page Crawler (Days 3-4)
- [ ] Pagination handling (476+ pages)
- [ ] Product card extraction and parsing
- [ ] Basic product info storage and detail URL extraction

### 4.3 Detail Page Crawler (Days 5-7)  
- [ ] Product detail page data extraction
- [ ] Technical specifications parsing
- [ ] Compliance documents and metadata processing

### 4.4 Parallel Processing & Optimization (Days 8-10)
- [ ] Concurrent page fetching with rate limiting
- [ ] Progress tracking and resumable crawling
- [ ] Database optimization and comprehensive error handling

## ðŸ”„ Phase 5: Basic Configuration Integration (3-5 days)

- [ ] Basic crawling configuration struct and file-based config
- [ ] Frontend crawling controls (start/stop/progress)
- [ ] Basic statistics and error reporting

## ðŸ“‹ Detailed Documentation

- **Implementation Plan**: [Implementation Priority Roadmap](./implementation-priority-roadmap.md)
- **Technical Design**: [Crawling Engine Design Analysis](./crawling-engine-design-analysis.md)
- **Full Project Status**: [PROJECT_STATUS.md](./PROJECT_STATUS.md)

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics

### Phase 4
- [ ] Successfully crawl 100+ Matter products
- [ ] Handle pagination without errors  
- [ ] Stable performance with rate limiting
- [ ] Accurate progress tracking

### Phase 5
- [ ] Configuration changes without restart
- [ ] Real-time crawling progress display
- [ ] Start/stop/configure through UI
- [ ] Basic error handling and feedback

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate**: Start Phase 4.1 (Basic Infrastructure)
2. **Week 1**: Complete listing page crawler with pagination
3. **Week 2**: Implement detail page crawler and optimization
4. **Week 3**: Begin basic configuration integration
